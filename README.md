single-market-robot-simulator-db-googledrive
=========

Persistent storage for simulation configurations.

Draft/Development branch.  May be unstable or not work.  Wait until >1.0 before using.

This module represents a new direction, and a significant departure from how other 
single-market-robot-simulator-db-* modules works, and is not compatible with the previous
modules' API.
